      <p>
        Plantify is an app designed to help users track and locate their plantings. 
        Our mission is to promote green initiatives and make it easier for everyone 
        to contribute to a greener planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users can mark the locations of their plantings, view ratings and reviews left 
        by other users, and use map integration to find the nearest and highest-rated 
        plantings. We also provide filters to search for specific types of plantings and 
        social sharing options to spread awareness.
